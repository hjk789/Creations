## Features

- **Invincibility**  
  The player character's health won't decrease when attacked. The character will still stagger, but won't ever die.

- **Infinite Basara**  
  The Basara gauge (blue bar) will always stay completely filled. As a result, the horse boost also becomes infinite, boosting as long as you keep the button pressed (circle).

- **EXP Multiplier**  
  Multiplies each experience points received by the number you specify (x10 by default).

- **Gold Multiplier**  
  Multiplies each gold received by the number you specify (x25 by default).

- **Battle Drive Always Ready**  
  Enables you to any time trigger the battle drive (the luminous glow, L2 button). By default it triggers the battle drive level 3 (redish glow), even if the character is still only able to use the battle drive level 1 (it will work regardless), but you can change in the script the battle drive level you prefer.

- **Infinite Battle Drive**  
  After the battle drive is triggered, the player character will stay in this mode forever, until the stage is completed.

- **Always Receive Battle Drive Level 3**  
  After every 100th enemy killed, you will get a battle drive level 3 rightaway instead of level 1, then 2, then 3.

- **Instant Charged Attack**  
  Launch a fully charged attack with a single tap on the skill button (triangle), instead of having to wait for the attack to finish charging.

- **Every Hit Is Critical**  
  Increases to 100% the critical hit chance (the big white flash when attacking), regardless of the weapon or items you're using.

- **Movement Speed Multiplier**  
  Makes the player character run faster by multiplying the movement speed by the number you specify (x1.40 by default).
  
- **Miscellaneous static addresses**  
  A collection of static addresses that you can tweak the values. Each character has their own set of static addresses used only by them, so I added only two characters, which includes the stage's basic values and an item selector (currently only for Masamune). It also includes character-independent addresses, such as camera coords and experience. I can't guarantee that these addresses will work for you though.
