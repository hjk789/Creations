## Features

- **Invincibility**  
  The player character's health won't decrease when attacked. The character will still stagger, but the health won't ever decrease.

- **Infinite Basara**  
  The Basara gauge (blue bar) will always stay completely filled. As a result, the horse boost also becomes infinite, boosting as long as you keep the button pressed (circle).

- **EXP Multiplier**  
  Multiplies each experience points received by the number you specify (x10 by default).

- **Gold Multiplier**  
  Multiplies each gold received by the number you specify (x25 by default).

- **Battle Drive Always Ready**  
  Enables you to any time trigger the battle drive (the luminous glow, L2 button). By default it triggers the battle drive level 3 (redish glow), even if the character is still only able to use the battle drive level 1 (it will work regardless), but you can change in the script the battle drive level you prefer.

- **Infinite Battle Drive**  
  After the battle drive is triggered, the player character will stay in this mode forever, until the stage is completed.

- **Always Receive Battle Drive Level 3**  
  After every 100th enemy killed, you will get a battle drive level 3 rightaway instead of level 1, then 2, then 3.

- **Instant Charged Attack**  
  Launch a fully charged attack with a single tap on the skill button (triangle), instead of having to wait for the attack to finish charging.

- **Every Hit Is Critical**  
  Increases to 100% the critical hit chance (the big white flash when attacking), regardless of the weapon or items you're using.

- **Movement Speed Multiplier**  
  Makes the player character run faster by multiplying the movement speed by the number you specify (x1.40 by default).
  
- **Item Selector**  
  Makes you able to choose any item, even if the item is not unlocked yet. It also includes the translated description of each item (adapted from [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/931480-sengoku-basara-2/faqs/44911)). After you are done choosing the items, you need to save the game to the memory card (i.e. save from inside the game) then load the save, otherwise the changes won't take effect. To do so, return to the main menu (the one after the start screen), choose the last option, press the circle button, and choose the second to last option inside the gray rectangle, and save it normally (choosing the option on the left two times, then confirming). Having done that, to load the save you can either choose the option below the one you just chose or reboot PCSX2. Keep in mind though that not all items will work, most will, but some won't.
  
- **Miscellaneous static addresses**  
  A collection of static addresses that you can tweak the values. Each character has their own set of static addresses used only by them, so I added only two characters, which includes the stage's basic values. It also includes character-independent addresses, such as camera coords and experience. I can't guarantee that these addresses will work for you though.
  
## How to use

- Download the [cheat table file](https://fearlessrevolution.com/download/file.php?id=29096&sid=1af00f7539d76a49aa45d38121652fb0) and open with Cheat Engine. 
- Make sure that Sengoku Basara 2 in PCSX2 is running, then activate the "Enable" script. The script will automatically attach to the process (provided that you are running the game on PCSX2 1.6.0, otherwise attach it manually or correct the process name in the script).
- When already in-battle, activate the cheats you want. Some cheats require that you do an action at least once to be able to activate, a message box will tell you what you need to do.
