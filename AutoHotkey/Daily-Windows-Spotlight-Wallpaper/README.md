# Daily Windows Spotlight Wallpaper

Automatically download the Windows Spotlight images and set as wallpaper. You also have the option to use Bing's Image of the Day instead.

## How to use

First you need the AutoHotkey interpreter, which can be downloaded from [AutoHotkey's website](https://www.autohotkey.com/), included either in the [setup wizard](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe) or the [ZIP archive](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk.zip).

Now you just have to run this script. If you used the setup, the .ahk extension is automatically associated with the AutoHotkey interpreter, otherwise if you used the ZIP, you have to run the script with the AutoHotkey.exe executable or manually associate it.

After that, you just need to set the script to be run on startup, either by putting a shortcut to the script in the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` directory or by scheduling it to be run on logon in the Task Scheduler, or whatever other way.

And it's done!

It was tested and works in Windows 10 1909 with AutoHotkey 1.1.33.2, but should also work in other variations.
